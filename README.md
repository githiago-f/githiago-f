## Code Design & Architecture
I'm passionate about creating well-designed, maintainable code. I focus on Domain Driven Development (DDD) and design patterns to create software that reflects user needs and is robust, scalable, and easy to maintain over time.

In my work as a developer, I incorporate DDD and design patterns into my code design and architecture. This allows me to create software that is effective, efficient, maintainable, and scalable.

If you're interested in learning more about my approach to code design and architecture or have any ideas or projects you'd like to collaborate on, feel free to reach out.
